Social Media Dashboard in React
Created a social media dashboard in React with TypeScript by following a prototype with the goal of recreating the design as close as possible using the assets provided. It is built for desktop and mobile screen widths by leveraging Tailwind CSS and includes a toggle to switch between light and dark mode.
Peer review: Caleb Sylvia
Peer review comments: Site looks like the prototype to a tee. Mobile and desktop function and are built the way they are supposed to be. Great Job no suggestions from me!
